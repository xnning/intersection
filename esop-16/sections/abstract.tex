Dunfield has shown that a simply typed core calculus with
intersection types and a merge operator forms a powerful foundation
for various programming language features. While his calculus
is type-safe, it lacks \emph{coherence}:
different derivations for the same expression can lead to different
results. The lack of coherence is important disadvantage for adoption
of his core calculus in implementations of programming languages, as
the semantics of the programming language becomes implementation
dependent. Moreover his calculus did not account for parametric polymorphism.

This paper presents \namedis: a core calculus with a variant of
\emph{intersection types} and a
\emph{merge operator}. The semantics \namedis is both type-safe and
coherent. Coherence is achieved by ensuring that intersection types
are \emph{disjoint}. Formally two types are disjoint if they do not
share a common supertype. We present a type system that prevents
intersection types that are not disjoint, as well as an algorithmic
specification to determine whether two types are disjoint. ...
