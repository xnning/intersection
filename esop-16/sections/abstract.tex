Dunfield has shown that a simply typed core calculus with intersection types and
a merge operator is able to capture various programming language features. While
his calculus is type-safe, it is known that it is not \emph{coherence}:
different derivations for the same expression can lead to different results. The
lack of coherence is an important disadvantage for adoption of his core calculus
in implementations of programming languages, as the semantics of the programming
language becomes implementation-dependent.

This paper presents \name: a core calculus with a variant of \emph{intersection
types} and a \emph{merge operator}. The semantics \name is both type-safe and
coherent. Coherence is achieved by ensuring that intersection types are
\emph{disjoint}. Formally, two types are disjoint if they do not share a common
supertype. We present a type system that prevents intersection types that are
not disjoint, as well as an algorithmic specification to determine whether two
types are disjoint. Moreover, we show the applicability of this calculus to
express a powerful form of dynamically composable traits, paving the way for new
designs of object-oriented programming languages.
