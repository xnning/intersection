\bruno{Be careful when using the word ``class'': we don't have classes in our system;
so talking about classes may simply confuse readers. You can talk about classes simply to say
that traits provide an alternative to classes. Often when you write ``class'' in the text, what

This section introduces \name and its support for intersection types and the
merge operator. It then discusses the issue of coherence and shows how the
notion of disjoint intersection types achieve a coherent semantics.

Note that this section uses some syntactic sugar, as well as standard
programming language features, to illustrate the various concepts in
\name. Although the minimal core language that we formalize in
Section~\ref{sec:fi} does not present all such features, our implementation
supports them.

\subsection{Intersection Types and the Merge Operator}
%%\subsection{Intersection Types, Merge and Polymorphism in \name}

Intersection types date back as early as Coppo et
al.'s work~\cite{coppo1981functional}. Since then various researchers have
studied intersection types, and some languages have adopted them in one
form or another.
%However, as we shall see in
%Section~\ref{subsec:incoherence}, it also introduces difficulties. In what follows
%intersection types and the merge operator are informally introduced.

\paragraph{Intersection types.}
The intersection of type $A$ and $B$ (denoted as \lstinline{A & B} in
\name) contains exactly those values
which can be used as either values of type $A$ or of type $B$. For instance,
consider the following program in \name:

\begin{lstlisting}
let x : Int & Char = (*$ \ldots $*) in -- definition omitted
let idInt (y : Int) : Int = y in
let idChar (y : Char) : Char = y in
(idInt x, idChar x)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent If a value \lstinline{x} has type \lstinline{Int & Char} then
\lstinline{x} can be used as an integer or as a character. Therefore,
\lstinline{x} can be used as an argument to any function that takes
an integer as an argument, or any
function that take a character as an argument. In the program above
the functions \lstinline{idInt} and \lstinline{idChar} are the
identity functions on integers and characters, respectively.
Passing \lstinline{x} as an argument to either one (or both) of the
functions is valid.

\paragraph{Merge operator.}
In the previous program we deliberately did not show how to introduce values of
an intersection type. There are many variants of intersection types in the
literature. Our work follows a particular formulation, where intersection types
are introduced by a \emph{merge operator}. As
Dunfield~\cite{dunfield2014elaborating} has argued a merge operator adds
considerable expressiveness to a calculus. The merge operator allows two values
to be merged in a single intersection type. For example, an implementation of
\lstinline{x} is constructed in \name as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
let x : Int & Char = 1,,'c' in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In \name (following Dunfield's notation), the
merge of two values $v_1$ and $v_2$ is denoted as $v_1 ,, v_2$.

\paragraph{Merge operator and pairs.}
The merge operator is similar to the introduction construct on pairs.
An analogous implementation of \lstinline{x} with pairs would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
let xPair : (Int, Char) = (1, 'c') in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent The significant difference between intersection types with a
merge operator and pairs is in the elimination construct. With pairs
there are explicit eliminators (\lstinline{fst} and
\lstinline{snd}). These eliminators must be used to extract the
components of the right type. For example, in order to use
\lstinline{idInt} and \lstinline{idChar} with pairs, we would need to
write a program such as:

\begin{lstlisting}
(idInt (fst xPair), idChar (snd xPair))
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In contrast the elimination of intersection types is done
implicitly, by following a type-directed process. For example,
when a value of type \lstinline{Int} is needed, but an intersection
of type \lstinline{Int & Char} is found, the compiler uses the
type system to extract the corresponding value.

\subsection{Incoherence}\label{subsec:incoherence}
Unfortunately the implicit nature of elimination for intersection
types built with a merge operator can lead to incoherence.
The merge operator combines two terms, of type $A$ and $B$
respectively, to form a term of type $A \inter B$. For example,
$1 \mergeop `c'$ is of type $\code{Int} \inter \code{Char}$. In this case, no
matter if $1 \mergeop `c'$ is used as $\code{Int}$ or $\code{Char}$, the result
of evaluation is always clear. However, with overlapping types, it is
not straightforward anymore to see the result. For example, what
should be the result of this program, which asks for an integer out of
a merge of two integers:
\begin{lstlisting}
(fun (x: Int) (*$ \to $*) x) (1,,2)
\end{lstlisting}
Should the result be \lstinline$1$ or \lstinline$2$?

If both results are accepted, we say that the semantics is \emph{incoherent}:
there are multiple possible meanings for the same valid program. Dunfield's
calculus~\cite{dunfield2014elaborating} is incoherent and accepts the program
above.

\paragraph{Getting around incoherence: biased choice.}
In a real implementation of Dunfield calculus a choice has to be made
on which value to compute. For example, one potential option is to
always take the left-most value matching the type in the
merge. Similarly, one could always take the right-most
value matching the type in the merge. Either way, the meaning
of a program will depend on a biased implementation choice,
which is clearly unsatisfying from the theoretical point of view
(although perhaps acceptable in practice).

\subsection{Restoring Coherence: Disjoint Intersection Types}\label{sec:restoring}
Coherence is a desirable property for a semantics. A semantics is said
to be coherent if any \emph{valid program} has exactly one
meaning~\cite{reynolds1991coherence} (that is, the semantics is not ambiguous).
One option to restore coherence is to reject programs which may have
multiple meanings.
%Of course, when rejecting programs it is important
%not to be too conservative, and reject too many programs which are
%actually coherent.
Analyzing the expression $1 \mergeop 2$, we can see that the reason
for incoherence is that there are multiple, overlapping, integers in the
merge. Generally speaking, if both terms can be assigned some type $C$,
both of them can be chosen as the meaning of the merge,
which leads to multiple meanings of a term.
Thus a natural option is to try to forbid such overlapping
values of the same type in a merge.

This is precisely the approach taken in \name. \name requires that the
two types of in intersection must be \emph{disjoint}.  However,
although disjointness seems a natural restriction to impose on
intersection types, it is not obvious to formalize it. Indeed Dunfield
has mentioned disjointness as an option to restore coherence, but he
left it for future work due to the non-triviality of the approach.

\paragraph{Searching for a definition of disjointness.}
The first step towards disjoint intersection types is to come up
with a definition of disjointness. A first attempt at such definition would
be to require that, given two types $A$ and $B$, both types are not
subtypes of each other. Thus, denoting disjointness as $A * B$, we would have:
\[A * B \equiv A \not<: B \wedge B \not<: A\]
At first sight this seems a reasonable definition and it does prevent
merges such as \lstinline{1,,2}. However some moments of thought are enough to realize that
such definition does not ensure disjointness. For example, consider
the following merge:

\begin{lstlisting}
(1,,'c') ,, (2,,True)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent This merge has two components which are also intersection
types. The first component \lstinline{(1,,'c')} has type $\code{Int} \inter
\code{Char}$, whereas the second component \lstinline{(2 ,, True)} has type
$\code{Int} \inter \code{Bool}$. Clearly,
\[ \code{Int} \inter \code{Char} \not \subtype \code{Int} \inter \code{Bool} \wedge \code{Int} \inter \code{Bool} \not \subtype \code{Int} \inter \code{Char} \]
Nevertheless the following program still leads to
incoherence:
\begin{lstlisting}
(fun (x: Int) (*$ \to $*) x) ((1,,'c'),,(2,,True))
\end{lstlisting}
as both \lstinline{1} or \lstinline{2} are possible outcomes
of the program. Although this attempt to define disjointness failed,
it did bring us some additional insight: although the types of the two
components of the merge are not subtypes of each other, they share
some types in common.

\paragraph{A proper definition of disjointness.} In order for two types
to be truly disjoint, they must not have any subcomponents sharing
the same type. In a system with intersection types this can be ensured
by requiring the two types do not share a common supertype. The
following definition captures this idea more formally.

\begin{definition}[Disjointness]
  Given two types $A$ and $B$, two types are disjoint
  (written $A \disjoint B$) if there is no type $C$ such that both $A$ and $B$ are
  subtypes of $C$:
  \[A \disjoint B \equiv \not\exists C.~A \subtype C \wedge B \subtype C\]
\end{definition}

\noindent This definition of disjointness prevents the problematic
merge. Since $\code{Int}$ is a common supertype of both $\code{Int} \& \code{Char}$ and
$\code{Int} \& \code{Bool}$, those two types are not disjoint.

\name's type system only accepts programs that use disjoint intersection
types. As shown in Section~\ref{sec:disjoint} disjoint intersection types will
play a crucial rule in guaranteeing that the semantics is coherent.

% \subsection{Parametric Polymorphism and Intersection Types}\label{subsec:polymorphism}
% Before we show how \name extends the idea of disjointness to parametric
% polymorphism, we discuss some non-trivial issues that arise from
% the interaction between parametric polymorphism and intersection types.
%The interaction between parametric polymorphism and
%intersection types when coherence is a goal is non-trivial.
%In particular biased choice .
%The key challenge is to have a type
%system that still ensures coherence, but at the same time is not too
%restrictive in the programs that can be accepted.
% Dunfield~\cite{} provides a
% good illustrative example of the issues that arise when combining
% disjoint intersection types and parametric polymorphism:
% \[\lambda x. {\bf let}~y = 0 \mergeop x~{\bf in}~x\]
% Consider the attempt to write
% the following polymorphic function in \name (we use
% uppercase Latin letters to denote type variables):
% \begin{lstlisting}
% let fst A B (x: A & B) = (fun (z:A) (*$ \to $*) z) x in (*$ \ldots $*)
% \end{lstlisting}
% The
% \code{fst} function is supposed to extract a value of type
% (\lstinline{A}) from the merge value $x$ (of type \lstinline{A&B}). However
% this function is problematic.  The reason is that when
% \lstinline{A} and \lstinline{B} are instantiated to non-disjoint
% types, then uses of \lstinline{fst} may lead to incoherence.
% For example, consider the following use of \lstinline{fst}:
% \begin{lstlisting}
% fst Int Int (1,,2)
% \end{lstlisting}
% \noindent This program is clearly incoherent as both
% $1$ and $2$ can be extracted from the merge and still match the type
% of the first argument of \lstinline{fst}.

% \paragraph{Biased choice breaks equational reasoning.} At first sight, one option
% to workaround the issue incoherence would be to bias the type-based merge lookup
% to the left or to the right (as discussed in
% Section~\ref{subsec:incoherence}). Unfortunately, biased choice is
% very problematic when parametric polymorphism is present in the language.
% To see the issue, suppose we chose to always pick the
% rightmost value in a merge when multiple values of same type exist.
% Intuitively, it would appear that the result of the use of
% \lstinline{fst} above is $2$. Indeed simple equational reasoning
% seems to validate such result:
% \begin{lstlisting}
%    fst Int Int (1,,2)
% (*$ \rightsquigarrow $*) (fun (z: Int) (*$ \to $*) z) (1,,2) -- (* \textnormal{By the definition of \code{fst}} *)
% (*$ \rightsquigarrow $*) (fun (z: Int) (*$ \to $*) z) 2      -- (* \textnormal{Right-biased coercion} *)
% (*$ \rightsquigarrow $*) 2                          -- (* \textnormal{By $\beta$-reduction} *)
% \end{lstlisting}
%
% However (assumming a straightforward implementation of right-biased
% choice) the result of the program would be 1! The reason for this has
% todo with \emph{when} the type-based lookup on the merge happens. In
% the case of \lstinline{fst}, lookup is triggered by a coercion
% function inserted in the definition of \lstinline{fst} at
% compile-time.
% In the definition of \lstinline$fst$ all it is known is that a
% value of type $A$ should be returned from a merge with an intersection
% type $A\&B$.  Clearly the only type-safe choice to coerce the value of
% type $A\&B$ into $A$ is to
% take the left component of the merge. This works perfectly for merges
% such as \lstinline$(1,,'c')$, where the types of the first and second components
% of the merge are disjoint. For the merge \lstinline$(1,,'c')$, if a integer lookup
% is needed, then \lstinline$1$ is the rightmost integer, which is consistent with the
% biased choice. Unfortunately, when given the merge \lstinline$(1,,2)$ the
% left-component (\lstinline$1$) is also picked up, even though in this case \lstinline$2$
% is the rightmost integer in the merge. Clearly this is inconsistent
% with the biased choice!
%
% Unfortunately this subtle interaction of polymorphism and type-based lookup
%  means that equational reasoning is broken!
% In the equational reasoning steps above, doing apparently correct
% substitutions lead us to a wrong result. This is a major problem for
% biased choice and a reason to dismiss it as a possible implementation
% choice for \name.

\begin{comment}
\paragraph{Conservatively rejecting intersections.}
To avoid incoherence, and the issues of biased choice, another option
is simply to reject programs where the
instantiations of type variables may lead to incoherent programs.
In this case the definition of \lstinline$fst$ would be rejected, since there
are indeed some cases that may lead to incoherent programs.
Unfortunately this is too restrictive and prevents many useful
programs.

We have built a source language that is desugared into \name. The most
central feature is the trait declaration. Trait can take several parameters,
which is then in scope in the body of the trait definition. In fact, trait
creation is dynamic, which means it can be contained inside a function.
