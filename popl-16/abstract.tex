Over the years there have been various proposals for \emph{design
  patterns} to improve \emph{extensibility} of programs.
Examples include \emph{Object Algebras}, \emph{Modular Visitors} or
Torgersen's design patterns using generics.
Although those design patterns give practical
benefits in terms of extensibility, they also expose limitations in
existing mainstream OOP languages. Some pressing
limitations are: 1) lack of good mechanisms for
\emph{object-level} composition; 2) \emph{conflation of
  (type) inheritance with subtyping}; 3) \emph{heavy reliance on generics}.

This paper presents System \name: an extension of System F with
\emph{intersection types} and a \emph{merge operator}.  The goal of System \name
is to study the minimal language constructs needed to support
various extensible designs, while at the same time addressing the
limitations of existing OOP languages. To address the lack of good
object-level composition mechanisms, System \name uses the merge
operator to do dynamic composition of values/objects. Moreover, in
System \name type inheritance is independent of subtyping, and an
extension can be a supertype of a base object type.  Finally, System
\name replaces many uses of generics by intersection types or
conventional subtyping. System \name is formalized and
implemented. Moreover the paper shows how various extensible designs
can be encoded in System \name.
