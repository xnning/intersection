This document describes how to find and use the following artifacts associated
with the paper ``Disjoint Intersection Types and Disjoint Quantification'':

\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{paper-full.pdf} --- full paper, including the appendix.

  \item \url{https://github.com/hkuplg/fcore.git} --- the implementation. To build and install the
  compiler, simply follow the instructions at \texttt{README.md} at the project
  root. Besides, what may be of special interest to the reader of this paper is
  the module \texttt{Simplify}, which translates $ F_\&$ to a variant of System
  $F$. It is located (relative to the project root) at \texttt{lib/simplify}.
  Also, the definition of the abstract syntax tree of System $F_\&$ is at
  \texttt{lib/SystemFI.hs}.

  \item \code{POPL.v} --- Coq proof script for reflexivity and transitivity of subtyping.
\end{itemize}
