\section{Application} \label{sec:application}

% Structural subtyping facilitates reuse~\cite{malayeri2008integrating}.
% \bruno{orphan sentence!}

This section shows that the System $ F $ plus intersection types are enough for
encoding extensible designs, and even beat the designs in languages with a much
more sophisticated type system (such as Scala). That is because \name has two
main advantages over existing languages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It supports dynamic composition of intersecting values.
\item It supports contravariant parameter types in the subtyping relation.
\end{enumerate}

Various solutions have been proposed to deal with the extensibility problems and
many rely on heavyweight language features such as abstract methods and classes
in Java. These two features can be used to improve existing designs of modular
programs.

\bruno{I would like to see a story about Church Encodings in
  \name. Can you look at Pierce's papers and try to write something
  along those lines? That will be a good intro for object algebras and
visitors!}

Church encoding modelling ADT using folds

% Introduce the expression problem

The Expression Problem~\cite{wadler1998expression} refers to the difficulty of
adding a new operations and a new data variant without changing or duplicating
existing code. We will be solving the Expression Problem to demonstrate the
capability of our language.

% There has been recently a lightweight solution to the expression problem that
% takes advantage of covariant return types in Java. We show that \name is able
% to solve the expression problem in the same spirit.

%   add = \(x : A & B). \(y : A & B). f.add x y ,, g.add x y
% };
% \end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Object Algebras}

% Object algebras provide an alternative to \emph{algebraic data types}
% (ADT).\bruno{We are targeting an OO crowd. Mentioning algebraic
%   datatypes is not going to be very useful there.}

%  For example, the
% following Haskell definition of the type of simple expressions
% \begin{lstlisting}{language=haskell}
% data Exp where
%   Lit :: Int -> Exp
%   Add :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp
% \end{lstlisting}
% can be expressed by the \emph{interface} of an object algebra of
% simple expressions:
% \begin{lstlisting}{language=scala}
% trait ExpAlg[E] {
%   def lit(x: Int): E
%   def add(e1: E, e2: E): E
% }
% \end{lstlisting}
% Similar to ADT, data constructors in object algebras are represented by functions such as
% \lstinline{lit} and \lstinline{add} inside an interface \lstinline{ExpAlg}.
% Different with ADT, the type of the expression itself is abtracted by a type
% parameter \lstinline{E}.

% which can be expressed similarly in \name as:
% \begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
% type ExpAlg E = {
%   lit : Int -> E,
%   add : E -> E -> E
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% Introduce Scala's intersection types

% Scala supports intersection types via the \lstinline{with} keyword. The type
% \lstinline{A with B} expresses the combined interface of \lstinline{A} and
% \lstinline{B}. The idea is similar to
% \begin{lstlisting}{language=java}
% interface AwithB extends A, B {}
% \end{lstlisting}
% in Java.
% \footnote{However, Java would require the \lstinline{A} and \lstinline{B} to be
%   concrete types, whereas in Scala, there is no such restriction.}

% The value level counterpart are functions of the type \lstinline
% {A => B => A with B}. \footnote{FIXME}

Oliveira~\cite{} noted that composition of object algebras can be cumbersome and
language support for intersection types would solve that problem. 
% Our type system is just a simple extension of System $ F $; yet surprisingly, it
% is able to solve the limitations of using object algebras in languages such as
% Java and Scala.
We will illustrate this point with an step-by-step of solving the Expression
Problem. Prior knowledge of object algebra is not assumed.

\paragraph{Initial features.}
As the base scenario, we consider expressions with two variants (literal and
addition) and one operation (evaluation). Here is an interface that supports
evaluation:
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
type IEval = {eval: Int};
\end{lstlisting}
and an object algebra interface, \lstinline$ExpAlg$, for expression types with
the two variants. It has fixed number of variants, but is abstracted over the
the type of the interpretation \lstinline$E$.
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
type ExpAlg[E] = {lit: Int -> E, add: E -> E -> E};
\end{lstlisting}
To illustrate the point of this abstraction, \lstinline$ExpAlg[IEval]$ will be
the type of object algebras with evaluation as the interpretation, whereas
\lstinline$ExpAlg[IEval & IPrint]$ will be the type of object algebras that
support both evaluation and pretty printing.

% In \name, record types are structural and hence any value that satisfies this
% interface is of type \lstinline$IEval$ or of a subtype of \lstinline$IEval$.
% \footnote{Should be mentioned in S2.}

Having defined the interfaces, we can implement that object algebra interface
with \lstinline$evalAlg$, which is an object algebra for evluation. Contrary to
nominal type systems as in most statically typed OO languages, the interface
being implemented here, \lstinline$ExpAlg[Int]$, is not required. But we put the
type ascription nonetheless for clarity and comparison.
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
let evalAlg: ExpAlg[E] = {
  lit = \(x: Int) -> {eval = x},
  add = \(x: IEval) (y: IEval) -> {eval = x.eval + y.eval}
};
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Add a subtraction variant.}
The first evolution is adding a new variant, say, subtraction. We can do so by
simply intersecting the original types and merging with the original values.
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
type SubExpAlg[E] = ExpAlg[E] & {sub: E -> E -> E};
let subEvalAlg = evalAlg ,, {sub = \(x: IEval) (y: IEval) -> { eval = x.eval - y.eval }};
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Add a pretty printing operation.}
As the second evolution, we add pretty printing. Similar to how we have defined
evaluation, we can describe the pretty printing feature as:
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
type IPrint = {print : String};
\end{lstlisting}
We can implement pretty printing for expressions that support literals,
addition, and subtraction:
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
let printAlg : SubExpAlg[String] = {
  lit = \(x: Int) -> {print = x.toString()},
  add = \(x: IPrint) (y: IPrint) -> {print = x.print ++ " + " ++ y.print},
  sub = \(x: IPrint) (y: IPrint) -> {print = x.print ++ " - " ++ y.print}
};
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Usage.}
Provided with the definitions above, we can then create values using the
appropriate algebras. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
let e1[E] (f: SubExpAlg[E]) = f.sub (f.lit 7) (f.lit 2);
\end{lstlisting}

The expressions are unusual in the sense that they are functions that take an
extra argument \lstinline$f$, the object algebras, and use the data constructors
provided by the object algebra (factory) \lstinline$f$ such as \lstinline$lit$,
\lstinline$add$ and \lstinline$sub$ to create values. Moreover, The algebras
themselves are abstracted over the allowed operations such as evaluation and
pretty printing by requiring the expression functions to take an extra argument
\lstinline$E$.

If we would like to have an expression that supports both evaluation and pretty
printing, we will need a mechanism to combine the evaluation and printing
algebras. Intersection types allows such composition: the \lstinline$merge$
function, which takes two expression algebras to create a combined algebra. It
does so by constructing a new expression algebra, a record whose each field is a
function that delegates the input to the two algebras taken.
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
let merge [A] [B] (f: ExpAlg[A]) (g: ExpAlg[B]) = {
  lit = \(x: Int) -> f.lit x ,, g.lit x,
  add = \(x: A & B) (y: A & B) ->
          f.add x y ,, g.add x y
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
let newAlg = merge[IEval] [IPrint] subEvalAlg printAlg;
let o = e1 [IEval&IPrint] newAlg;
o.print ++ " = " ++ o.eval.toString()
\end{lstlisting}
% \bruno{Don't start a sentence with \lstinline$o1$.}
Note that \lstinline$o1$ is a single object created that supports both
evaluation and printing, thus achieving feature-oriented programming in this
sense.

\subsection{Visitors}

The visitor pattern~\cite{gamma1994design} is another design pattern that
facilitates extensibility. The gist of this pattern is to decouple an object
hierarchy from the behaviors of each object. In other words, objects no longer
contain operations but instead ``accept'' visitors to perform operations on
them. The visitor pattern tackles at the very problem that makes programming in
traditional OO styles hard to add a new operation, since operations are defined
inside object classes that represent data structures. As a result, using the
visitor pattern allows adding new operations to existing structures without
modifying code of structures, a style enjoyed by functional programming. To see
this in action, we define the type of expressions as:
\begin{lstlisting}{language=scala}
trait Exp {
  def accept(v: ExpVisitor[A]): A
}
\end{lstlisting}
It has only one method \lstinline$accept$. The actual shape of the expressions
(i.e., variants) is determined by the type of the visitor, which we define in
another trait:
\begin{lstlisting}{language=scala}
trait ExpVisitor[E] {
  def lit(x: Int): E
  def add(e1: E, e2: E): E
}
\end{lstlisting}

One serious problem that prevents using the visitor pattern modularly in
languages such as Scala arises when later when we want to add more cases to the
expression type. For example, \lstinline$SubExp$ and \lstinline$SubExpVisitor$
together represent the type of expressions supporting subtraction, in addition
to literal and addition.
\begin{lstlisting}{language=scala}
trait SubExp extends Exp {
  override def accept[E](v: SubExpVisitor[E]): E
}
trait SubExpVisitor[E] extends ExpVisitor[E] {
  def sub(e1: E, e2: E): E
}
\end{lstlisting}
We extend the original visitor and add the new case.

The body of \lstinline{Exp} and \lstinline{SubExp} are almost the same: they
both contain an \lstinline{accept} method that takes an algebra \lstinline{f}
and returns a value of the type \lstinline{E}. The only difference is at
\lstinline{f} --- \lstinline{SubExpAlg[E]} is a subtype of
\lstinline{ExpAlg[A]}. Since \lstinline{f} appear in parameter position of
\lstinline{accept} and function parameters are contravariant, naturally we would
hope that \lstinline{SubExp[E]} is a supertype of \lstinline{Exp[E]}. However,
such subtyping relation does not fit well in Scala because inheritance implies
subtyping in such languages \footnote{It is still possible to encode
  contravariant parameter types in Scala but doing so would require some
  technique.\bruno{what technique?}}. As \lstinline{SubExp[E]} extends
\lstinline{Exp[E]}, the former becomes a subtype of the latter. This suffers
from the ``Inheritance is Not Subtyping'' problem.

Such limitation does not exist in \name. For example, we can define the similar
interfaces for \lstinline{Exp} and \lstinline{SubExp} as type aliases:
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
type Exp    = {accept: forall A. ExpAlg[A] -> A};
type SubExp = {accept: forall A. SubExpAlg[A] -> A};
\end{lstlisting}
Then by the typing judgment it holds that \lstinline{SubExp} is a supertype of
\lstinline{Exp}. This relation gives desired results. To give a concrete
example:

First we define two data constructors for simple expressions:
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
let lit (n: Int): Exp = {
  accept = /\E -> \(f: ExpVisitor[E]) -> f.lit n
};
let add (e1: Exp) (e2: Exp): Exp = {
  accept = /\E -> \(f: ExpVisitor[E]) -> f.add (e1.accept[E] f) (e2.accept[E] f)
};
\end{lstlisting}

Later we augment the expressions with subtraction:
\begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
let sub (e1: SubExp) (e2: SubExp): SubExp =
  { accept = /\E -> \(f : SubExpVisitor[E]).
               f.sub (e1.accept[E] f) (e2.accept[E] f) };
\end{lstlisting}

% One big benefit of using the visitor pattern is that programmers are able to
% define structures in a more natural way. 

As client code, \lstinline$e2 = sub (lit 2) (lit 3)$ defines an expression. The
programmer is able to pass \lstinline{lit 2}, which is of type \lstinline{Exp},
to \lstinline{sub}, which expects a \lstinline{SubExp}. The types are compatible
because because \lstinline$Exp$ is a \emph{subtype} of \lstinline$SubExp$. Code
reuse is achieved since we can use the constructors from \lstinline$Exp$ as the
constructor for \lstinline$SubExp$. In Scala, we would have to define two
literal constructors, one for \lstinline$Exp$ and another for
\lstinline$SubExp$! \bruno{Subtyping needs to be much more emphasized! See
  Modular Visitor Components! }

% \subsection{Yanlin stuff}
% \bruno{This can be dropped.}

% This subsection presents yet another lightweight solution to the Expression
% Problem, inspired by the recent work by Wang. It has been shown that
% contravariant return types allows refinement of the types of extended
% expressions.

% First, we define the type of expressions that support evaluation and implement
% two constructors:
% \begin{lstlisting}
% type Exp = { eval: Int }
% let lit (n: Int) = { eval = n }
% let add (e1: Exp) (e2: Exp)
%   = { eval = e1.eval + e2.eval }
% \end{lstlisting}

% If we would like to add a new operation, say pretty printing, it is nothing more
% than refining the original \lstinline{Exp} interface by \emph{intersecting} the
% original type with the new \lstinline{print} interface using the \lstinline{&}
% primitive and \emph{merging} the original data constructors using the \lstinline{,,}
% primitive.
% \begin{lstlisting}
% type ExpExt = Exp & { print: String }
% let litExt (n: Int) = lit n ,, { print = n.toString() }
% let addExt (e1: ExpExt) (e2: ExpExt)
%   = add e1 e2 ,,
%     { print = e1.print.concat(" + ").concat(e2.print) }
% \end{lstlisting}

% Now we can construct expressions using the constructors defined above:
% \begin{lstlisting}
% let e1: ExpExt = addExt (litExt 2) (litExt 3)
% let e2: Exp = add (lit 2) (lit 4)
% \end{lstlisting}
% \lstinline{e1} is an expression capable of both evaluation and printing, while
% \lstinline{e2} supports evaluation only.

% We can also add a new variant to our expression:
% \begin{lstlisting}
% let sub (e1: Exp) (e2: Exp) = { eval = e1.eval - e2.eval }
% let subExt (e1: ExpExt) (e2: ExpExt)
%   = sub e1 e2 ,, { print = e1.print.concat(" - ").concat(e2.print) }
% \end{lstlisting}

% Finally we are able to manipulate our expressions with the power of both
% subtraction and pretty printing.
% \begin{lstlisting}
% (subExt e1 e1).print
% \end{lstlisting}

% \subsection{Mixins}

% \bruno{Still not convinced by this section. Change to the record-based example.}
% Mixins are useful programming technique wildly adopted in dynamic programming
% languages such as JavaScript and Ruby. But obviously it is the programmers'
% responsbility to make sure that the mixin does not try to access methods or
% fields that are not present in the base class.

% In Haskell, one is also able to write programs in mixin style using records.
% However, this approach has a serious drawback: since there is no subtyping in
% Haskell, it is not possible to refine the mixin by adding more fields to the
% records. This means that the type of the family of the mixins has to be
% determined upfront, which undermines extensibility.

% \name is able to overcome both of the problems: it allows composing mixins
% that (1) extends the base behavior, (2) while ensuring type safety.

% The figure defines a mini mixin library. The apostrophe in front of types
% denotes call-by-name arguments similar to the \lstinline{=>} notation in the
% Scala language.

% \begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
% type Mixin S = 'S -> 'S -> S;
% let zero S (super : 'S) (this : 'S) : S = super;
% let rec mixin S (f : Mixin S) : S
%   = let m = mixin S in f (\ (_ : Unit). m f) (\ (_ : Unit). m f);
% let extends S (f : Mixin S) (g : Mixin S) : Mixin S
%   = \ (super : 'S). \ (this  : 'S). f (\ (d : Unit). g super this) this;
% \end{lstlisting}

% We define a factorial function in mixin style and make a \lstinline{noisy} mixin
% that prints ``Hello'' and delegates to its superclass. Then the two functions
% are composed using the \lstinline{mixin} and \lstinline{extends} combinators.
% The result is the \lstinline{noisyFact} function that prints ``Hello'' every
% time it is called and computes factorial.
% \begin{lstlisting}{language=F2J}
% let fact (super : 'Int -> Int) (this : 'Int -> Int) : Int -> Int
%   = \ (n : Int). if n == 0 then 1 else n * this (n - 1)
% let noisy (super : 'Int -> Int) (this : 'Int -> Int) : Int -> Int
%   = \ (n : Int). { println("Hello"); super n }
% let noisyFact = mixin (Int -> Int) (extends (Int -> Int) foolish fact)
% noisy 5
% \end{lstlisting}
