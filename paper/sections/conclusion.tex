\section{Conclusion and Further Work}

We have described a simple type system suitable for extensible
designs. \bruno{summarize the work in a few sentences.}  There are
various avenues for future work. On the one hand we are interested in
creating a source language where extensible designs such as object
algebras or modular visitors are supported by proper language
features.On the other hand we would like to explore extending our
structural type system with nominal subtyping to allow more familiar
programming experience and investigate type inference.
