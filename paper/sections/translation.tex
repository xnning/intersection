\section{Type-directed Translation to System $ F $}

In this section we define the semantics of \name by means of a type-directed
translation to a variant of System $ F $ extended with tuples. This translation
removes the labels of records and turns intersections into products, much like
Dunfield's elaboration. But our translation also deals with parametric
polymorphism and records.

\subsection{Informal Discussion}

To help the reader have a high-level understanding of how the translation works,
in this subsection we present the translation informally. Take the \name
expression for example:
\begin{lstlisting}
{ eval = 4, print = "4" }.eval
\end{lstlisting}

First, multi-field record literals are desugared into merges of single-field
record literals. Therefore
\begin{lstlisting}
{ eval = 4, print = "4" }
\end{lstlisting}
becomes
\begin{lstlisting}
{ eval = 4 } ,, { print = "4" }
\end{lstlisting}
Merges of two values are translated into just a pair of them by $ \rulelabelemerge $
and single-field record literals lose their field labels by $ \rulelabelereccon $.
Hence \lstinline $ { eval = 4 } ,, { print = "4" } $ becomes \lstinline
$ (4, "4") $.

Finally, $ e1 $ and $ e2 $ are both coerced by a projection function
$ \\(x:(Int,String)). \proj 1 x $.
\bruno{Show the source program, and the program that it gets
  translated to. Then explain how that translation works.}

\subsection{Target Language}

The target language is System $ F $ extended with pairs. The syntax and typing
is completely standard. The syntax of System $ F $ is as follows:
% \bruno{fill!}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \input{rule_in_figures/f-syntax.tex}
  \caption{Target syntax.}
  \label{fig:f-syntax}
\end{figure}
while its semantics can be found in standard texts~\cite{pierce2002types}.

% \bruno{Why is this lemma placed here?}
% \bruno{Generaly Speaking this text seems out of place.Move to 5.4, maybe?}

The main translation judgment is $ \Gamma \turns e : \tau \hookrightarrow E $ which
states that with respect to the environment $ \Gamma $, the \name expression
$ e $ is of a \name type $ \tau $ and its translation is a System $ F $ expression $ E $.

We also define the type translation function $ \im \cdot $ from \name types
$ \tau $ to System $ F $ types $ T $.

\begin{figure}[h]
\input{rule_in_figures/type-trans.tex}
\caption{Type translation.}
\end{figure}

The first three rules of the translation is standard. For the last two, the
intersection of two types are translated into a product of them, and the label
of record types are erased.

The translation consists of four sets of rules, which are explained below:

\subsection{Subtyping (Coercion)}

\george{Talk about $ \eta $-expansion.}

\begin{figure*}
\input{rule_in_figures/trans-sub.tex}
\caption{Coersive subtyping.}
\end{figure*}

The coercion judgment $ \Gamma \turns \tau_1 \subtype \tau_2 \yields C $
extends the subtyping judgment with a coercion on the right hand side of
$ \hookrightarrow $. A coercion $ C $ is an expression in the target language
and has type $ \tau_1 \to \tau_2 $, as proved by Lemma \ref{type-coerce}. It is
read ``In the environment $ \Gamma $, $ \tau_1 $ is a subtype of $ \tau_2 $; and
if any expression $ e $ has a type $ \tau_1 $ that is a subtype of the type of
$ \tau_2 $, the elaborated $ e $, when applied to the corresponding coercion $ C $,
has exactly type $ \im \tau_2 $''. For example,
$\Gamma \turns Int \& Bool <: Bool \yields {fst} $, where $ fst $ is the
projection of a tuple on the first element. The coercion judgment is only used
in the $ \rulelabeleapp $ case. As $ \rulelabelsubfun $ supports contravariant parameter
type and covariant return type, the coercion of the parameter types and that of
the return types are used to create a coercion for the function type.
$ \rulelabelsubandleft $, $ \rulelabelsubandright $, and $ \rulelabelsuband $ deal with intersection types.
The first two are complementary to each other. Take $ \rulelabelsubandleft $ for example,
if we know $ \tau_1 $ is a subtype of $ \tau_3 $ and $ C $ is a coercion from $ \tau_1 $
to $ \tau_3 $, then we can conclude that $ \tau_1 \andop \tau_2 $ is also a subtype of
$ \tau_3 $ and the new coercion is a function that takes a value $ x $ of type
$ \tau_1 \andop \tau_2 $, project $ x $ on the first item, and apply $ C $ to it.
$ \rulelabelsuband $ uses both of two coercions and constructs a pair.
\bruno{Give a couple of concrete examples when explaining the rules.}

\subsection{Typing (Translation)}

In this subsection we now present formally the translation rules that convert
\name expressions into System $ F $ ones. This set of rules essentially extends
those in the previous section with the light-blue part for the translation.

\paragraph{Translation}

  The elaboration judgment $ \Gamma \turns e : \tau \yields E $ extends the
  typing judgment with an elaborated expression on the right hand side of
  $ \hookrightarrow $. The translation ensures that $ E $ has type
  $ \im \tau $. It is also standard, except for the case of $ \rulelabeleapp $, in
  which a coercion from the inferred type of the argument, $ e_2 $ , to the
  expected type of the parameter, $ \tau_1 $, is inserted before the argument;
  $ \rulelabelemerge $ translates merges into pairs. $ \rulelabelereccon $ uses the
  same System $ F $ expression $ E $ for $ e $ as for $ \reccon l e $. And in
  $ \rulelabelerecproj $ and $ \rulelabelerecupd $ the coercions generated by the ``get''
  and ``put'' rules will be used to coece the main \name expression.

  $ \rulelabelerecproj $ typechecks $ e $ and use the ``get'' rule to return the
  type of the field $ \tau_1 $ and the coecion $ C $. The type of the whole
  expression is $ \tau_1 $ and its translation of $ \app C E $.

  $ \rulelabelerecupd $ is similar to $ \rulelabelerecproj $ in that it uses the
  auxiliary ``put'' rule. This rule typechecks $ e $ and $ e_1 $, and uses the
  ``put'' rule. Note that it allows refining of types by an $ e_1 $ that is of a
  subtype of $ \tau_1' $, which is the type of the field $ l $ in $ e $. The type
  of the updated expression then takes the type $ \tau' $ returned by the ``put''
  rule, while its translation is $ E $, applied to the coercion generated by the
  ``put'' rule, $ C $.

  The two set of rules are explained below.

\paragraph{``get'' Rules}

  The ``get'' judgment deals spefically with record elimination and yields a
  coercion can be thought as a field accessor. For
  example:\bruno{Still not showing the derivations!}

  $ \Gamma \turnsget (\{ \code{eval} : \code{Int} \}, \code{eval}) : \{ \code{eval} : \code{Int} \} \yields {\lam x \code{Int} x} $

  The lambda is the field accessor and when applied to a translated expression
  of type $ \{ \code{eval} : \code{Int} \}$, it is able to give the desired
  field. $ \rulelabelget $ is the base case: the type of the field labelled
  $ l $ in a $ \recty l \tau $ is just $ \tau $ and the coercion is an identity
  function specialized to type $ \im {\recty l \tau} $ $ \rulelabelgetleft $ and
  $ \rulelabelgetright $ are complementary to each other.

  Consider the source program:
  \begin{lstlisting}
    ({ name = "Isaac", age = 10 }).name
  \end{lstlisting}

  Multi-field records are desugared into merge of single-field records:
  \begin{lstlisting}
    ({ name = "Isaac"} ,, { age = 10 }).name
  \end{lstlisting}

  By $ \rulelabelget $,
  \[ \turnsget (\recty {name} {String}; {name}) : String \]

  we have the coercion
  \[ \lam x {\im {\recty {name} {String}}} x \]

  which is just $ \lam x {String} x $ according to type translation.

  By $ \rulelabelgetleft $,
  \[ \turnsget (\recty {name} {String} \andop \recty {age} {Int}; {name}) : String \]

  % we have the coercion
  % \[ \abs {\rel x {\im {\recty {name} {String} \andop \recty
  %         {age} {Int}}}} \app {(\abs {\rel x {\im {\recty {name} {String}}}} x)} {(\fst ~ x)} \]
  % which is just $ \abs {\rel x {(String, Int)}} {\app {(\abs {\rel x {String}} x)} {(\fst ~ x)}} $ by type translation.

  By typing rules, the translation of the program is
  \[ ("Isaac", 10) \]. If we apply the coercion to it, we get
  \[ "Isaac" \]


\paragraph{``put'' Rules}\bruno{Missing example (and derivation)}

  The ``put'' judgment deals spefically with record update can be thought as
  producing a field updater. Compared to the ``get'' rules, the ``put'' rules
  take an extra input $ e $, which is the desired expression to replace the
  field lablled $ l $ in values of type $ \tau $. $ \rulelabelput $ is the base
  case. This rule allows refinement of record fields in the sense that the type
  of $ e $ can be a subtype of the type of the field labelled by $ l $. The
  resulting type is $ \recty l {\tau'} $ and the generated coercion is a
  constant function that always returns $ E $. $ \rulelabelputleft $ and
  $ \rulelabelputright $ are complementary to each other: the idea is exactly the
  same as $ \rulelabelgetleft $ and $ \rulelabelgetright $ except that the refined type
  $ \tau_1' $ and $ \tau_2' $ is used.
