\section{The \name calculus} \label{sec:fi}

\george{Discuss duplicate labels}

Following Dunfield's~\cite{dunfield2014elaborating} work on a simply-typed
lambda calculus with intersection and union types, we present the syntax,
subtyping, and typing of \name. The semantics of \name, on the other hand, will
be defined by a type-directed translation from \name to a simple variant of
System $F$ in the next section.

\subsection{Syntax}

Figure~\ref{fig:fi-syntax} shows the syntax of \name (with the addition to
System $F$ highlighted). As a convention in this paper, we will be using
lowercase letters as meta-variables for sorts in \name, and uppercase letters
for those in the target language (starting to appear in the next section).

% To System $ F $, we add two features: intersection types and single-field
% records.
% % ~\bruno{labelled types (single field records are fine too)} 
% We include only single records because single record types as the multi-records
% can be desugared into the merge of multiple single records.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \input{rule_in_figures/fi-syntax.tex}
  \caption{Syntax of \name.}
  \label{fig:fi-syntax}
\end{figure}

Meta-variables $\tau$ are ranged over types. Types include System $F$ constructs
variable $ \alpha $; the top type $\top$ (supertype of all types); function
types $ \tau_1 \to \tau_2 $; and type abstraction $ \for \alpha \tau $.
$ \tau_1 \andop \tau_2 $ denotes the intersection of type $ \tau_1 $ and
$ \tau_2 $; and $ \recty l \tau $ the types for single-field records.
Single-field record types can be viewed as types tagged with a label $l$, while
the other type forms are untagged types. We omit type constants such as
\lstinline$Int$ and \lstinline$String$.
% \bruno{be consistent: in the source language we use \&, and in the
% formalization we use $\andop$}

Expressions are ranged over by meta-variables $e$. Standard constructs in System
$F$ are variables $ x $; the canonical term that inhabits the top type, also
written as $\top$; abstraction of expressions over variables of a given type
$\lam x \tau e$ (concretely written \lstinline$\(x:T) -> e$); 
abstraction of expressions over types $\blam \alpha e$ (concretely written \lstinline$/\A -> e$); 
application of expressions to expressions $\app {e_1} {e_2}$; 
and application of expressions to types $\tapp e \tau$ (concretely written \lstinline$e[T]$). 
The last four constructs are new:
$e_1 \mergeop e_2$ is the \emph{merge} of two expressions $e_1$ and $e_2$.
% \bruno{explain further, after all this is new.}
It can be used as either $ e_1 $ or $ e_2 $. Particarly, if one regard $e_1$
and $e_2$ as objects, their merge will responds to every method that one or
both of them have. Merge of expressions correspond to intersection types
$ \tau_1 \andop \tau_2 $. $ \reccon l e $ constructs a single-field record.
$ e.l $ accesses the field labelled $ l $ in $ e $. 
\begin{comment}
Note that $ e $ does not
need to be a record type in this case. For example, although the merge of two
records
\[
x = \reccon {l_1} {e_1} \mergeop \reccon {l_1} {e_2} 
\]
is of an intersection type, $ x.{l_1} $ still gives $ e_1 $. On the other hand,
$ x.{l_3} $ will be rejected by the type system. 
\end{comment}
Restriction $e \restrictop l$ removes the field $l$ inside $e$. In order to
focus on the most essential features, we do not include other forms such as
fixpoints here, although they have are supported in our implementation and can
be included in formalization in standard ways.

\bruno{Talking about type-checking before type-checking is discussed!}
% \bruno{What field $F$? I don't know what this is refering to!}

Typing contexts $ \gamma $ track bound type variables and variables (and their
type $\tau$). We use $l$ for labels, whose nature is left undefined. We use
$\subst {\tau_1} \alpha {\tau_2}$ for the capture-avoiding substitution of
$\tau_1$ for $\alpha$ inside $\tau_2$ and $\ftv \cdot$ for sets of free
variables.

\paragraph{Discussion.} A natural question the reader might ask is that why we
have excluded union types from the language. The answer is we found that
intersection types alone are enough support extensible designs. To focus on the
key features that make this language interesting, we also omit other common
constructs. For example, fixpoints can be added in standard ways.
% Dunfield has described a language that includes a ``top'' type but it does not
% appear in our language. Our work differs from Dunfield in that ...

\subsection{Subtyping}

% \bruno{Fix the overflow. For example by using 2 lines in
%   the conclusion.}

% \bruno{Subtyping figure is doing the translation already?}

\george{Explain the subst syntax.}\bruno{Just say, in 1 sentence: 
the syntax means substitution, and the substitution function is standard 
and thus ommitted.}

\george{However, have we forbidden the interplay of subtyping relations
  explicitly declared by programmers as seen in class-based OO languages?}
\bruno{Discuss somewhere (perhaps in related work) that although 
our system is structural, we could apply the idea of separating 
inheritance and subtyping to a nominal language. Point out related work.}

\bruno{Intersection types require a simple form of subtyping. The subtyping
  relation is reflexive and transitive. Our subtyping relation follows previous
  work. Need to cite! The main difference is the interaction with parametric
  polymorphism.}

In some calculi, the subtyping relation is external to the language: those
calculi are indifferent to how the subtyping relation is defined. In \name, we
take a syntatic approach, that is, subtyping is due to the syntax of types.
However, this approach does not preclude integrating other forms of subtyping
into our system. One is ``primitive'' subtyping relations such as natural
numbers being a subtype of integers. The other is nominal subtyping relations
that are explicitly declared by the programmer.

\begin{figure*}
  \small
  \input{rule_in_figures/fi-sub.tex}
  \caption{Subtyping in \name.}
  \label{fig:fi-subtyping}
\end{figure*}

Subtyping rules of \name are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fi-subtyping}. They them
are not very surprising. The rule $\rulelabelsubfun$ says that functions are
contravariant in their parameter type and covariant in their return type. A
universal quantifier ($\forall$) is covariant in its body. A single-field record
type is also covariant, which becomes obvious if we regard it as just a labelled
type. The three rules dealing with intersection types are just what one would
expect when interpreting types as sets. Under this interpretation, for example,
the rule $\rulelabelsuband$ says that if $\tau_1$ is both the subset of $\tau_2$
and $\tau_3$, then $\tau_1$ is also the subset of the intersection of $\tau_2$
and $\tau_3$.

% Intersection types introduce natural subtyping relations among types. For
% example, $ \Int \andop \Bool $ should be a subtype of $ \Int $, since the former
% can be viewed as either $ \Int $ or $ \Bool $. To summarize, the subtyping rules
% are standard except for three points listed below:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item $ \tau_1 \andop \tau_2 $ is a subtype of $ \tau_3 $, if \emph{either} $ \tau_1 $ or
%   $ \tau_2 $ are subtypes of $ \tau_3 $,

% \item $ \tau_1 $ is a subtype of $ \tau_2 \andop \tau_3 $, if $ \tau_1 $ is a subtype of
%   both $ \tau_2 $ and $ \tau_3 $.

% \item $ \recty {l_1} {\tau_1} $ is a subtype of $ \recty {l_2} {\tau_2} $, if
%   $ l_1 $ and $ l_2 $ are identical and $ \tau_1 $ is a subtype of $ \tau_2 $.
% \end{enumerate}
% The first point is captured by two rules $ \rulelabelsubandleft $ and
% $ \rulelabelsubandright $, whereas the second point by $ \rulelabelsuband $.
% Note that the last point means that record types are covariant in the type of
% the fields.

It is easy to see that subtyping is reflexive and transitive. For the
corresponding mechanized proofs in Coq, refer to \textit{sub\_refl.v} and
\textit{sub\_trans.v}.

\subsection{Typing}

\begin{figure*}
  \small
  \input{rule_in_figures/fi-typing.tex}
  \caption{The type system of \name.}
  \label{fig:fi-typing}
\end{figure*}

The typing of \name is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fi-typing}. It consists of one
main typing judgment and two auxiliary judgments. The main typing judgment is of
the form: $ \judgee \gamma e \tau $. It says that ``in the typing context
$\gamma$, the expression $e$ is of type $\tau$''. The rules that are the same as
in System $F$ are rules for variables ($\rulelabelevar$), lambda abstractions
($\rulelabelelam$), type abstraction ($\rulelabeleblam$), and type application
($\rulelabeletapp$). The rule $\rulelabeleapp$ needs special attention as we add
a subtyping requirement in the premise: the type of the argument ($\tau_3$) is a
subtype of that of the parameter ($\tau_1$). The advantage is that it then
becomes easier to derive an algorithm for typechecking. For merges
$e_1 \mergeop e_2$, we typechecks $e_1$ and $e_2$ respectively, and give it the
intersection of the resulting types $\tau_1 \andop \tau_2$. The rule for
single-field record construction ($\rulelabelereccon$) is standard. The rules
for record selection ($\rulelabelerecselect$) and restriction
($\rulelabelerecrestrict$) are expectedly the most complicated. They turn to the
auxiliary ``select'' and ``restrict'' rules to statically check operations and
to obtain resulting types.

The ``select'' judgment deals with record selection. For example,
\[
\judgeselect {\recty {\texttt{id}} \Int \andop \recty {\texttt{name}} \String}
{\texttt{name}} {\String}
\]
That means the $\texttt{name}$ field inside
$\recty {\texttt{id}} \Int \andop \recty {\texttt{name}} \String$ is of type
$\texttt{name}$. Formally, $\judgeselect {\tau_1} l {\tau_2}$ says that a field
labelled $l$ is present inside $\tau_1$ and is of type $\tau_2$. The judgment is
made of three inference rules and is recursively defined. $\rulelabelselect$ is
the base case: if we ask for a field labelled $l$ inside $\recty l \tau$, the
field is clearly present and is of type $\tau$. $\rulelabelselectleft$ and
$\rulelabelselectright$ are two symmetric step cases. Take
$\rulelabelselectleft$ for example, it means that if $l$ is present inside
$\tau_1$, then it is also present inside $\tau_1 \andop \tau_2$; and the type of
the desired field $l$ remains $\tau$ in the conclusion.

The ``restrict'' judgment $\judgerestrict {\tau_1} l {\tau_2}$ deals with record
restriction and is very similar to the ``select'' judgment. The only difference
is that instead of giving the type of field being selected, the judment holds
the type after the restriction. For example,
\[
\judgerestrict {\recty {\texttt{id}} \Int \andop \recty {\texttt{name}} \String}
{\texttt{name}} {\recty {\texttt{id}} \Int \andop \top}
\]

% The ``restrict'' judgment deals with record restriction and is similar to the
% ``select'' judgment in spirit. Consider the same example:
% \begin{lstlisting}
% {id: Long, name: String, score: Float}
% \end{lstlisting}
% If we want to remove the \lstinline$score$ field to something of
% type \lstinline$Double$ the judgment will returns a new type where the type of
% the field in question has been updated
% \begin{lstlisting}
% {id: Long, name: String, score: Double}
% \end{lstlisting}
% along with the original type of the field \lstinline$score$, which is
% \lstinline$Float$. More precisely,
% $\judgeupdate {\tau_1} l {\tau_2} {\tau_3} {\tau_4}$ says that if we want to update
% an expression of type $\tau_1$ by replacing the content of the field $l$ with a
% term of type $\tau_2$, then the new type of the entire expression after the
% update is $\tau_3$ and the original type of the field $l$ is $\tau_4$.

% \bruno{Sort the rules by those, which are exactly the same as System F,
%   following by those which are different (application) and finally the rules for
%   the new constructs.}

\bruno{A lot more explanation needed here! You want to
   explain: 1) the rules which are different, and why they are
   different; 2) the new rules and the intuition for the new rules.
   For the new rules have text for each of them.}

% The last two rules make use of the $ \rulename{fields} $ function just to make
% sure that the field being accessed ($ \rulelabelerecselect $) or updated
% ($ \rulelabelerecupd $) actually exists. The function is defined recursively, in
% Haskell pseudocode, as:
% \[ \begin{array}{rll}
%   \fields{\alpha} & = & \rel{\cdot} {\alpha} \\
%   \fields{\tau_1 \to \tau_2} & = & \rel{\cdot} {\tau_1 \to \tau_2} \\
%   \fields{\forall \alpha. \tau} & = & \rel{\cdot} {\forall \alpha. \tau} \\
%   \fields{\tau_1 \andop \tau_2} & = & \fields{\tau_1} \dplus \fields{\tau_2} \\
%   \fields{\recty l \tau} & = & \rel l t
% \end{array} \]
% where $ \cdot $ means empty list, $ \dplus $ list concatenation, and $ : $ is an
% infix operator that prepend the first argument to the second. The function
% returns an associative list whose domain is field labels and range types.
