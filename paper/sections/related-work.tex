Nystrom et. al. OOPSLA 06

Applications:

- Object/Fold Algebras. How to support extensibility in an easier way.

See Datatypes a la Carte

- Mixins

- Lenses? Can intersection types help with lenses? Perhaps making the
types more natural and easy to understand/use?

- Embedded DSLs? Extensibility in DSLs? Composing multiple DSL interpretations?
