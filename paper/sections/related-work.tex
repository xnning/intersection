\section{Related Work}

Strictly speaking, the system we have described is not intersection in the
set-theoretic sense, but rather ``implicit pairs'' whose introduction is
explicit by using the merge operator and elimination is implicit.

\subsection{Intersection Types with Parametric Polymorphism}

Pierce's describes a prototype language with both intersection types and
parametric polymorphism.

\subsection{Other Type Systems with Intersection Types}

Reynolds, Castagna, and Dunfield all describe elaborating multi-fields records
into merge of single-field records. However Reynolds and Castagna do not
consider elaboration and Dunfield do not formalize elaborating records.

\subsection{Type Systems for Modularity}

\subsection{Extensible Records and Row Types}

\subsection{Other Related Work}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\bf Elaborating simply-typed lambda calculus}

  Dunfield has introduced a type system with intersection polymorphism but no
  parametric polymorphism.

- Mixins

- Lenses? Can intersection types help with lenses? Perhaps making the
types more natural and easy to understand/use?

- Embedded DSLs? Extensibility in DSLs? Composing multiple DSL interpretations?
