\begin{abstract}
  
  Over the years there have been various proposals for \emph{design
    patterns} for improved \emph{extensibility} of programs.
  Examples include \emph{Object Algebras}, \emph{Modular Visitors} or
  Torgersen's four design patterns using generics.
%  Such design patterns typically rely on generics and subtyping and
%  can be encoded in existing mainstream Object-Oriented Programming
%  (OOP) languages. 
  Although those design patterns give practical
  benefits in terms of extensibility, they also expose limitations in
  existing mainstream OOP languages. In particular two pressing
  limitations are: 1) the lack of good mechanisms for
  \emph{object-level} composition; 2) the \emph{conflation of 
    (type) inheritance with subtyping}.

  This paper presents System \name: an extension of System F with
  intersection types and a merge operator.  The goal of
  System \name is to study the foundational language constructs that
  are needed to support various extensible designs, while at the same
  time addressing the limitations of existing OOP languages. To
  address the lack of good object-level composition mechanisms, System
  \name uses the merge operator to allow dynamic composition of
  values/objects. Moreover, in System \name type inheritance is
  independent of subtyping, and it is possible for an extension to be
  a supertype of a base object type.  System \name is formalized and 
  implemented. Furthermore the paper illustrates how various extensible designs   
  can be encoded in System \name.
