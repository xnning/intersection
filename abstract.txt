Title: Extensibility with F2J

Abstract:

At the core of F2J is a language known as System FI, which is just a
light-weight extension of System F. Simple as it seems, the type system is
enough for employing various extensible designs that are sometimes clumsy to use
even in those existing languages with a rich type system. For example, it is
able to solve the limitations of using object algebras Java and Scala. Moreover,
the type system allows even improvements on those designs. In this talk, I will
show you what F2J has provide us in terms of the ease of programming.
