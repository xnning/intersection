\section{Application: Extensible records}
\label{subsec:records}

\joao{change syntax to the one used in overview}
Our system can be used to encode records, similarly to way as discussed in 
\cite{dunfield2014elaborating}. 
However, describing and implementing records within programming languages is certainly not novel 
and has been extensively studied in the past.
Most of the systems are entirely focused on concrete aspects of records 
(i.e. expressiveness, compilation, etc), while ours will specialize the more general notion of  
intersection types.
In this section we aim at comparing our approach with such systems. 

Systems with records usually rely on 3 basic operations: selection, restriction and 
extension/concatenation. 
We will first introduce these basic operations in the context of \name.

\subsection{Basic operations}
\paragraph{Selection}

The select operator is directly embedded in our language. 
It follows the usual syntax of $e.l$, where $e$ is an expression of type $\recordType l \alpha$ and 
$l$ is a label.
A polymorphic function which extracts any record that include the label $l$ of type
$\alpha$ could be written as:
\begin{align*}
&\text{select} :: \fordis \alpha \top {\recordType l \alpha \rightarrow \alpha} \\
&\text{select} \, = \blamdis \alpha \top {\lam x {x.l}}
\end{align*}

Note how, through the use of subtyping, this function will accept any intersection type that contains
the single recorld $\recordType l \alpha$.
This resembles other systems ..., although it is slightly more general, as any it is not 
restricted only to record types. \joao{references}

\paragraph{Restriction}

In constrast with most systems, restriction is not directly embedded on our language.
Instead, we can make use of subtyping to define such operator: 
\begin{align*}
&\text{remove} :: \fordis \alpha \top {\fordis r {\recordType l \alpha} 
{({\recordType l \alpha \inter r) \rightarrow r}}} \\ 
&\text{remove} \, = \blamdis \alpha \top {\blamdis r {\recordType l \alpha} {\lam x {x}}} 
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Extension/Concatenation}

The most usual operators for combining records are extension and concatenation.
Even though that in some systems, the latter is defined in terms of the former, languages that
opt to include concatenation usually rely on specific semantics for it. \joao{add references}
Our system is suitable for encoding both of these operations, but we argue that concatenation is
the natural primitive operator, due to the resemblance with our merge operator.
Indeed, (Harper \& Pierce) also define a \emph{merge} operator, which is quite similar to
our \emph{merge} for intersection types, except it envoles only record types.
For instance, a function which concatenates a single record with field $l$ of type $\tyint$
with another record that lacks this field, is the following (slightly modified in terms of 
notation):
\begin{align*}
&\text{addL}_1 :: \forall \alpha\#l. \alpha \rightarrow (\alpha || \recordType l \tyint) \\ 
&\text{addL}_1 \, = ...
\end{align*}
The reader might notice the resemblance with our system:
\begin{align*}
&\text{addL}_2 :: \fordis \alpha {\recordType l \tyint} {
\alpha \rightarrow (\alpha \inter \recordType l \tyint)} \\
&\text{addL}_2 \, = ...
\end{align*}
This shows that one can use disjoint quantification to express negative field information.
It is very close to what (Harper \& Pierce) describe in their system.  
Note how we have to explicitly state the type of the constraint in $\text{addL}_2$, whereas 
$\text{addL}_1$ does not require this.
The same generality of disjoint intersection types that allows one to encode record types is the
one that forces us to add this extra type in the constraint.
However, there is a slight gain with this approach: $\text{addL}_2$ accepts more types than
$\text{addL}_1$.
Namely, all (intersection) types that contain label $l$, with a field type \emph{disjoint} to
$\tyint$.

Had one meant to forbid records with \emph{any} $l$ fields, then one could write:

\joao{how about this? fresh beta vs bottom?}
\begin{align*}
&\text{addL}_3 :: \fordis \beta \top {\fordis \alpha {\recordType l \beta} {
\alpha \rightarrow (\alpha \inter \recordType l \beta)}} \\
&\text{addL}_3 \, = ...
\end{align*}

Other systems with record concatenation usually define predicates, in terms of field absence or 
presence (with a type $\alpha$). 
This rises the question: how would one classify our system in terms of extension? 
As noted in~\cite{leijen2004first}, systems typically can be categorized into two distinct groups
in what concerns extension: the strict and the free.
The former does not allow field overriding when extending a record (i.e. one can only extend a 
record with a field that is not present in it); while the latter does account for field overriding.
Our system can be seen as hybrid of these two kinds of systems.
Next we will show a comparison in terms of expressability between \name and other systems 
with records that hopefully will enlighten the reader on this matter.

\subsection{Expressibility}
In ... (SPJ \& MJ) -- a strict system with extension -- an example of a function that uses 
record types is the following:
\begin{align*}
&\text{average}_1 :: (r \backslash y, r \backslash x) \Rightarrow \{r | x :: \tyint, y :: \tyint\} \rightarrow \tyint \\
&\text{average}_1 \, r = (r.x + r.y) / 2
\end{align*}

The type signature says that for any record with type $r$, that lacks both $x$ $y$, can be accepted
as parameter extended with $x$ $y$, returning an integer.
Note how the bounded polymorphism is essential to ensure that $r$ does not contain $x$ nor $y$.
On the other hand, in a system with free extension as in~\cite{leijen2005extensible}, 
the more general program would be accepted:
\begin{align*}
&\text{average}_2 :: \forall x \; y, \{ x :: \tyint, y :: \tyint | r \} \rightarrow \tyint \\
&\text{average}_2 \, r = (r.x + r.y) / 2
\end{align*}

In this case, if $r$ contains either field $x$ or field $y$, they would be shadowed by the labels 
present in the type signature.
In other words, if a record with multiple $x$ fields, the most recent (i.e. left-most) would be used 
in any function which accesses $x$.
\joao{add example of a system using subtyping?}

In \name, such function could be re-written as
\footnote{We do not support exactly this function definition style; 
however the type signature and expression (module infix operators) are exactly as one would write them
in \name}:
\begin{align*}
&\text{average}_3 :: \fordis r 
{\recordType x \tyint \inter \recordType y \tyint} 
{\recordType x \tyint \inter \recordType y \tyint \inter r \rightarrow \tyint} \\
&\text{average}_3 = 
{\blamdis t {\recordType x \tyint \inter \recordType y \tyint} {\lam r {(r.x + r.y) / 2}}}
\end{align*}

Thus more types are accepted this function than in the first system, but less than the second. 
Another major difference between \name and the two other mentioned systems, is the ability to 
combine records with arbitrary types.
Our system does not account for well-formedness of record types as the other two systems do 
(i.e. using a special \emph{row} kind), since our encoding of records piggybacks on the more
general notion of disjoint intersection types. 

Finally, it is also worth noting that systems using subtyping may suffer from the so-called 
\emph{update} problem.
\joao{show example (for both update problems?)}
\name does not suffer from this problem. \joao{since we have no refinement types?}
We may illustrate by defining a suitable update function, in a similar fashion 
to~\cite{leijen2005extensible}:
\begin{align*}
&\text{update} :: \fordis \alpha \top {\fordis r {\recordType l \alpha} 
{{\recordType l \alpha \inter r \rightarrow \beta \rightarrow \recordType l \beta \inter r}}} \\ 
&\text{update} \, = \blamdis \alpha \top {\blamdis r {\recordType l \alpha} {\lam x {\lam v {
\recordCon l v \mergeop (\text{remove } \alpha \; r \; x)}}}} 
\end{align*}

\section{Application: Extensibility}
\label{subsec:OAs}

Various solutions to the Expression
Problem~\cite{wadler1998expression} in the
literature~\cite{Swierstra:2008,finally-tagless,oliveira09modular,oliveira2012extensibility,DelawareOS13}
are closely related to type-theoretic encodings of datatypes. Indeed, variants
of the same idea keep appearing in different programming languages,
because the encoding of the idea needs to exploit the particular
features of the programming language (or theorem prover).
Unfortunately language-specific constructs obscure the key ideas
behind those solutions.

In this section we show a solution to the
Expression Problem that intends to capture the key ideas of various
solutions in the literature. Moreover, it is shown how \emph{all the
  features} of \namedis (intersection types, the merge operator,
parametric polymorphism and disjoint quantification) are needed to
properly encode one important combinator~\cite{oliveira2013feature} used to compose
multiple operations over datatypes.

%The combination of parametric polymorphism, intersection types and the
%merge operator is useful to encode datatypes with subtyping and
%support extensibility in \namedis. The combination of
%polymorphism and the merge operator is essential to allow the
%composition of multiple operations over datatypes.
%In the following
%we present a step-by-step solution to the Expression Problem in \namedis,
%and illustrate how to combine multiple operations.

%Oliveira and Cook~\cite{oliveira2012extensibility} proposed a design pattern that can solve the
%Expression Problem in languages like Java. An advantage of the pattern
%over previous solutions is that it is relatively lightweight in terms
%of type system features. In a latter paper, Oliveira et al.~\cite{oliveira2013feature}
%noted some limitations of the original design pattern and proposed
%some new techniques that generalized the original pattern, allowing it
%to express programs in a Feature-Oriented Programming~\cite{Prehofer97} style.
%Key to these techniques was the ability to dynamically compose object
%algebras.
%
%Unfortunatelly, dynamic composition of object algebras is
%non-trivial. At the type-level it is possible to express the resulting
%type of the composition using intersection types. Thus, it is still
%possible to solve that part problem nicely in a language like Scala (which
%has basic support for intersection types). However, the dynamic
%composition itself cannot be easily encoded in Scala. The fundamental
%issue is that Scala lacks a \lstinline{merge} operator (see the
%discussion in Section~\ref{subsec:interScala}). Although both Oliveira et al.~\cite{oliveira2013feature} and
%Rendell et al.~\cite{rendel14attributes} have shown that such a \lstinline{merge} operator can
%be encoded in Scala, the encoding fundamentally relies in low-level
%programming techniques such as dynamic proxies, reflection or
%meta-programming.
%
%Because \namedis supports a \lstinline{merge} operator natively, dynamic
%object algebra composition becomes easy to encode. The remainder of
%this section shows how object algebras and object algebra composition
%can be encoded in \namedis. We will illustrate this point
%step-by-step by solving the Expression Problem.
%%Prior knowledge of object algebras is not assumed.

% can be cumbersome and
% language support for intersection types would solve that problem.
% Our type system is just a simple extension of System $ F $; yet surprisingly, it
% is able to solve the limitations of using object algebras in languages such as
% Java and Scala.

\subsection{Church Encoded Arithmetic Expressions}
In the Expression Problem, the idea is to start with a very simple
system modeling arithmetic expressions and evaluation.
The standard typed Church encoding ~\cite{BoehmBerarducci} for arithmetic expressions,
denoted as the type \lstinline{CExp}, is:

\begin{lstlisting}
type CExp = (*$ \forall $*)E. (Int (*$ \to $*) E) (*$ \to $*) (E (*$ \to $*) E (*$ \to $*) E) (*$ \to $*) E
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent However, as done in various solutions to extensibility, it is better to break
down the type of the Church encoding into two parts:

\begin{lstlisting}
type ExpAlg[E] = {
  lit: Int (*$ \to $*) E,
  add: E (*$ \to $*) E (*$ \to $*) E
} in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent The first part, captured by the type \lstinline{ExpAlg[E]}
is constitutes the so-called algebra of the datatype. For additional
clarity of presentation, records (supported in the implementation of \namedis)
are used to capture the two components of the algebra.
The first component abstracts over the type of the
constructor for literal expressions ($\tyint \to E$). The second
component abstracts over the type of addition expressions
($E \to E \to E$).

The second part, which is the actual type of the Church encoding, is:

\begin{lstlisting}
type Exp = { accept: (*$ \forall $*)E. ExpAlg[E] (*$ \to $*) E } in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent It should be clear that, modulo some refactoring, and the
use of records, the type \lstinline{Exp} and \lstinline{CExp}
are equivalent.

\paragraph{Data constructors.}
Using \lstinline{Exp} the two data constructors are defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
let lit (n: Int): Exp = {
  accept = (*$ \Lambda $*)E (*$ \to $*) fun (f: ExpAlg[E]) (*$ \to $*) f.lit n
} in
let add (e1: Exp) (e2: Exp): Exp = {
  accept = (*$ \Lambda $*)E (*$ \to $*) fun (f: ExpAlg[E]) (*$ \to $*)
    f.add (e1.accept[E] f) (e2.accept[E] f)
} in
(*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the notation $\Lambda E$ in the definition of the
\lstinline{accept} fields is a type abstraction: it
introduces a type variable in the environment. The definition of the
constructors themselves follows the usual Church encodings.

Simple expressions, can be built using the data constructors:

\begin{lstlisting}
let five : Exp = add (lit 3) (lit 2) in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Operations.} Defining operations over expressions requires
implementing \lstinline{ExpAlg[E]}. For example, an interesting
operation over expressions is evaluation. The first step is to define
the evaluation operation is to chose how to instantiate the type
parameter \lstinline{E} in \lstinline{ExpAlg[E]} with a suitable
concrete type for evaluation. One such suitable type is:

\begin{lstlisting}
type IEval = { eval: Int } in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Using \lstinline{IEval}, a record \lstinline{evalAlg}
implementing \lstinline{ExpAlg} is defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
let evalAlg: ExpAlg[IEval] = {
  lit = fun (x: Int) (*$ \to $*) { eval = x },
  add = fun (x: IEval) (y: IEval) (*$ \to $*) {
    eval = x.eval + y.eval
  }
} in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

In this record, the two operations
\lstinline{lit} and \lstinline{add} return a record with type
\lstinline{IEval}. The definition of \lstinline{eval} for
\lstinline{lit} and \lstinline{add} is straightforward.


%The type \lstinline$ExpAlg[IEval]$ is the type of object algebras
%supporting evaluation.
%However, the one interesting point
%of object algebras is that other operations can be supported as
%well.

Using \lstinline{evalAlg}, the expression \lstinline{five} can
be evaluated as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
(five.accept[IEval] evalAlg).eval
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Extensibility and Subtyping} Of course, in the Expression
Problem the goal is to achieve extensibility in two dimensions: constructors and operations.
Moreover, in the presence of subtyping it is also interesting to see how the extended datatypes
relate to the original datatypes. We discuss the two topics next.

\paragraph{New constructors.} Here is the code needed to add a new subtraction constructor:
%Arithmetic expressions with subtyping are defined using the type \lstinline{SubExp}:

\begin{lstlisting}
type SubExpAlg[E] = ExpAlg[E] & { sub: E (*$ \to $*) E (*$ \to $*) E } in
type SubExp = { accept: (*$ \forall $*)A. SubExpAlg[A] (*$ \to $*) A } in
let sub (e1: SubExp) (e2: SubExp): SubExp = {
  accept = (*$ \Lambda $*)E (*$ \to $*) fun (f : SubExpAlg[E]) (*$ \to $*)
    f.sub (e1.accept[E] f) (e2.accept[E] f)
} in
(*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Firstly \lstinline{SubExpAlg} defines an extended algebra
that contains the constructors of \lstinline{ExpAlg} plus the new
subtraction constructor. Intersection types are used to do the type
composition. Secondly, a new type of expressions with subtraction
(\lstinline{SubExp}) is needed. For \lstinline{SubExp} it is important
that the \lstinline{accept} field now takes an algebra of type
\lstinline{SubExpAlg} as argument. This is necessary to define the
constructor for subtraction (\lstinline{sub}), which requires the
algebra to have the field \lstinline{sub}.


\paragraph{Extending existing operations.} In order to use evaluation
with the new type of expressions, it is necessary to also extend
evaluation. Importantly, extension is achieved using the merge operator:

\begin{lstlisting}
let subEvalAlg = evalAlg ,, {
  sub = fun (x: IEval) (y: IEval) (*$ \to $*) {
    eval = x.eval - y.eval
  }
} in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In the code, the merge operator takes \lstinline{evalAlg}
and a new record with the implementation of evaluation for
subtraction, to define the implementation for arithmetic expressions
with subtraction.

\paragraph{Subtyping.} In the presence of subtyping, there are
interesting subtyping relations between datatypes and their
extensions~\cite{oliveira09modular}.  Such subtyping relations are usually not
discussed in theoretical treatments of Church encodings. This is
probably partly due to most work on typed Church encodings being
done in calculi without subtyping.

The interesting aspect about subtyping in typed Church encodings is
that subtyping follows the opposite direction of the extension.  In
other words subtyping is contravariant with respect to the
extension. Such contravariance is explained by the type of the
\lstinline{accept} field, which is a function where the argument type
is refined in the extensions. Thus, due to the contravariance of
subtyping on functions, the extension becomes a supertype of the
original datatype.

In the particular case of expressions \lstinline{Exp} (the original and smaller
datatype) is a subtype of \lstinline{SubExp} (the larger and extended
datatype). Because of this subtyping relation, writing the following
expression is valid in \namedis:

\begin{lstlisting}
let three : SubExp = sub five (lit 2)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Note the \lstinline{three} is of type \lstinline{SubExp},
but the first argument (\lstinline{five}) to the constructor
\lstinline{sub} is of type \lstinline{Exp}. This can only type-check
if \lstinline{Exp} is indeed a subtype of \lstinline{SubExp}.





\paragraph{New operations.}
The second type of extension is adding a new operation, such as pretty printing.
Similarly to evaluation, the interface of the pretty printing feature
is modeled as:
%\begin{comment}
%  \begin{lstlisting}
%    type IPrint = { print : String } in (*$ \ldots $*)
%  \end{lstlisting}
%\end{comment}
\begin{lstlisting}
type IPrint = { print: String } in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}
The implementation of pretty printing for expressions that support literals,
addition, and subtraction is:

\begin{lstlisting}
let printAlg: SubExpAlg[IPrint] = {
  lit = fun (x: Int) (*$ \to $*) {
    print = x.toString()
  },
  add = fun (x: IPrint) (y: IPrint) (*$ \to $*) {
    print = x.print ++ " + " ++ y.print
  },
  sub = fun (x: IPrint) (y: IPrint) (*$ \to $*) {
    print = x.print ++ " - " ++ y.print
  }
} in (*$ \ldots $*)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent The definition of \lstinline{printAlg} is unremarkable.
With \lstinline{printAlg} we can pretty print the expression represented
by \lstinline{three}:

\begin{lstlisting}
(three.accept[IPrint] printAlg).print
\end{lstlisting}

%\begin{comment}
%The result is \lstinline$"7 - 2"$. Note that the programmer is able to pass \lstinline{lit 2}, which is of type \lstinline{Exp},
%to \lstinline{sub}, which expects a \lstinline{SubExp}. The types are compatible
%because because \lstinline$Exp$ is a \emph{subtype} of \lstinline$SubExp$. Code
%reuse is achieved since we can use the constructors from \lstinline$Exp$ as the
%constructor for \lstinline$SubExp$. In Scala, we would have to define two
%literal constructors, one for \lstinline$Exp$ and another for
%\lstinline$SubExp$.
%\end{comment}
%
\subsection{Composition of Algebras}
The final example shows a non-trivial combinator for algebras that
allows multiple algebras to be combined into one. A version of this
combinator has been encoded in Scala before using intersection types
(which Scala supports) and an encoding of the merge
operator~\cite{oliveira2013feature,rendel14attributes}.
Unfortunatelly, the Scala encoding of the merge operator is quite complex as
it relies on low-level type-unsafe programming features such as
dynamic proxies, reflection or other meta-programming techniques.
In \namedis there is no need for such hacky encoding, as the
merge operator is natively supported. Therefore the combinator for
composing algebras is implemented much more elegantly.
The combinator is defined by the \lstinline$combine$ function, which takes two object algebras to create
a combined algebra. It does so by constructing a new algebra
where each field is a function that delegates the input to the two
algebra parameters.

\begin{lstlisting}
let combine A (B * A) (f: ExpAlg[A]) (g: ExpAlg[B]) :
  ExpAlg[A & B] = {
    lit = fun (x: Int) (*$ \to $*) f.lit x ,, g.lit x,
    add = fun (x: A & B) (y: A & B) (*$ \to $*)
      f.add x y ,, g.add x y
}
\end{lstlisting}

Note how \lstinline{combine} requires all the interesting
features of \namedis. Parametric polymorphism is needed because
\lstinline{combine} must compose algebras with arbitrary type
parameters. Intersection types are needed because the resulting
algebra will create values with an intersection type composing
the two type parameters of the two input algebras. The merge operator
is needed to compose the results of each algebra together. Finally,
a disjointness constraint is needed to ensure that the two input
algebras build values of disjoint types (otherwise ambiguity could
arize).

With \lstinline{combine} printing and evaluation of expressions with
subtraction is done as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
let newAlg: ExpAlg[IEval&IPrint] =
    combine[IEval,IPrint] evalAlg printAlg in
let o = five.accept[IEval&IPrint] newAlg in
o.print ++ " = " ++ o.eval.toString()
\end{lstlisting}

Note that \lstinline$o$ is a value that supports both
evaluation and printing. The final expression uses \lstinline{o}
for doing both printing and evaluation.
