This document describes how to find and use the following artifacts associated
with the paper ``System $F_\&$: A Simple Core Language for Extensibility'':

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implementation of the compiler
  \item Runnable code examples written in our source language
  \item Mechanized proofs in Coq
\end{itemize}

\section*{Implementation}

The implementation of the compiler (in Haskell) is publicly available at:
\url{https://github.com/hkuplg/fcore.git}. To build and install the compiler,
simply follow the instructions at \texttt{README.md} at the project root. Besides,
what may be of special interest to the reader of this paper is the module
\texttt{Simplify}, which translates $ F_\&$ to a variant of System $F$. It is
located (relative to the project root) at \texttt{lib/simplify}.
Also, the definition of the abstract syntax tree of System $F_\&$
is at \texttt{lib/SystemFI.hs}.

\section*{Code examples}

Two code examples that are used in the paper (Section 3) can be found at:
\url{https://github.com/zhiyuanshi/intersection/tree/master/src}. One is named
\texttt{ObjectAlgebra.sf}, the other \texttt{Visitor.sf}. To run the examples,
you need a working installation of the compiler described in the previous
section. Here is how you would try out the examples at command line
(\texttt{f2j} is the name of the compiler; passing the \texttt{-r} flag
additionally runs the program):
\begin{lstlisting}
$ f2j ObjectAlgebra.sf -r
ObjectAlgebra using [Naive]
Compiling to Java source code ( ./ObjectAlgebra$.java )
7 + 2 = 9
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{Coq proofs}

Coq proofs can be found at:
\url{https://github.com/zhiyuanshi/intersection/blob/master/coq/Inter.v}
